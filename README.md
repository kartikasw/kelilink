# Kelilink
Consists of submodules: Kelilink (customer) and Kelilink Seller. These two applications facilitate interactions between street food vendors and their customers to improve the efficiency of  queuing systems. **Kelilink Seller** enables food vendors to efficiently manage their stores, including their food catalogs, stock availability, and customer orders. On the other hand, **Kelilink** enables the customers to order and  queue online, while also providing recommendations of nearby vendors based on distance.

Both applications are developed using the same tech stack:
- Firebase (Firabase Authentication, Firestore, FCM for push notification)
- Reactive programming using Coroutine Flow
- Dependency injection using Hilt-Dagger
- Maps SDK
- MVVM with clean architecture
